# BIOPOLE – Chukchi Sea Metatranscriptomics

Metatranscriptomic analysis of nitrogen-cycling pathways in Arctic marine microbial communities

This repository contains the full reproducible workflow for processing, assembling, and analysing metatranscriptomic data from 10 Arctic marine eRNA samples collected as part of the BIOPOLE programme, focusing on nitrogen-processing pathways (denitrification and anammox) in the Chukchi Sea.

The pipeline includes raw sequencing QC, rRNA removal, metatranscriptome assembly, read mapping, and downstream functional analysis using anvi’o.BIOPOLE_Chukchi_metaT
Bioinformatics pipeline applied to the eRNA samples from the Chukchi Sea expedition as part of the BIOPOLE project
