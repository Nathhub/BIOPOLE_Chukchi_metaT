The option -O 3 was used, meaning that trimming occurred in reads where at least 3bp of adapter sequence was observed at the 3’ end of the read. The reads were further trimmed to remove low quality bases with a minimum window quality score of 20. After trimming, reads shorter than 15 bp were removed. Only read pairs are retained, therefore if a read of a pair is trimmed away then the other read in the pair is also discarded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote📝 Notes on Low-Yield Samples\n\n\n\n4-S13S returned an exceptionally low number of reads because very little RNA was recovered from the corresponding Sterivex filters. This limited input material resulted in poor library complexity and low overall sequencing yield.\n10-negative_control is a processing negative control sample and therefore contains no biological RNA. The very low read count is expected and confirms that minimal contamination occurred during library preparation."

Diagram from https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?md:M00529\n\n\nFrom the output of anvi-estimate-metabolism, we can look for the KEGG module for Denitrification (M00529) and look at its completeness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKEGG Module\nStation\nstepwise_module_completeness\npathwise_module_completeness\n\n\n\n\nM00529\nStation_1\n1.00\n1.00\n\n\nM00529\nStation_2\n1.00\n1.00\n\n\nM00529\nStation_3\n1.00\n1.00\n\n\n\nSo all the genes required for denitrification to occur seem to be detected at each of the stations.\nLet’s look at the denitrification pathway in more details using anvi-interactive, so we can see the coverage of the genes involved in denitrification across the 3 depths in the stations.\nFirst, we need to create an anvi’o collection that contains all the denitrification genes. Using anvi-export-functions we can get the gene_callers_ids matching your KO IDs, then we can get the contigs name using anvi-export-table –table genes_in_contigs. After that we need to use join to find the contigs that have the genes of interest and finally we need to add “_split_00001” to each contig name (because in this case each contig has only one split as these come from metaT assembly. We ad a column with the name of our bin and then can import that using anvi-import-collection\n\n\nCode\nanvi-export-functions   -c St1_contigs.db   -o St1_gene_functions.tsv\nanvi-export-table --table genes_in_contigs -o St1_genes_in_contigs.tsv St1_contigs.db\ntail -n +2 St1_genes_in_contigs.tsv | cut -f1,2 &gt; gene_to_contig.tsv\n\n# KO list for denitrification (edit/add as needed)\nKOS='K00370|K00371|K00374|K02567|K02568|K00368|K15864|K04561|K02305|K00376'\n# Get unique gene_callers_id hits for those KOs\nawk -F'\\t' -v kos=\"$KOS\" '($3 ~ kos){print $1}' St1_gene_functions.tsv   | sort -u &gt; genes_of_interest.ids\njoin -t $'\\t' genes_of_interest.ids gene_to_contig.tsv   | cut -f2   | sort -u &gt; contigs_of_interest.txt\nawk '{print $1\"_split_00001\\tdenitrification\"}' contigs_of_interest.txt   &gt; denitrification_splits_collection.tsv\n\nanvi-import-collection   -p St1_MERGED/PROFILE.db   -c St1_contigs.db   -C denitrification_splits denitrification_splits_collection.tsv\n\n\nNow that we have an anvio collection, we need to “split” it from the main contigs and profile databases (we create a subset). This is because our initial contigs.be has too many splits (1,432,906 splits to be precise) and hierarchical clustering gets turned off.\nOnce it is splitted we can find a directory called “denitrifications_splits” in which we find a contigs and profile database that we can now plot using anvi-interactive.\nFirst, we will import the data about the presence/absence of the genes of interest (from Module M00529) so we can visualise where they are found.\n\n\nCode\nanvi-export-functions   -c CONTIGS.db   -o gene_functions.tsv\n\n# 1) Define your KO list (space-separated)\nKOS=\"K00370 K00371 K00374 K02567 K02568 K00368 K15864 K04561 K02305 K00376\"\n\n# 2) Build gene-level KO presence/absence from gene_functions.tsv (KO is column 3)\nawk -F'\\t' -v OFS='\\t' -v kos=\"$KOS\" '\nBEGIN{\n    n = split(kos, k, \" \")\n    for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) KO[k[i]] = 1\n    printf \"gene_callers_id\"\n    for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) printf \"%s%s\", OFS, k[i]\n    printf \"\\n\"\n}\nNR==1 { next }  # skip header\n{\n    gene = $1\n    acc  = $3\n    genes[gene] = 1\n    if (acc in KO) present[gene, acc] = 1\n}\nEND{\n    for (g in genes) {\n        printf \"%s\", g\n        for (i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {\n            ko = k[i]\n            v = ((g SUBSEP ko) in present) ? 1 : 0\n            printf \"%s%d\", OFS, v\n        }\n        printf \"\\n\"\n    }\n}\n' gene_functions.tsv &gt; KO_presence_absence_by_gene.tsv\n\n# 3) Map gene_callers_id -&gt; contig (requires genes_in_contigs.tsv from anvi-export-gene-calls)\n#    Then collapse to contig-level by OR (max) across genes\nawk -F'\\t' -v OFS='\\t' '\nNR==FNR {\n    if (FNR==1) next\n    gene2contig[$1] = $2\n    next\n}\nFNR==1 { print \"contig\", substr($0, index($0, \"\\t\")+1); ncol=NF; next }\n{\n    gene = $1\n    contig = (gene in gene2contig) ? gene2contig[gene] : \"NA\"\n    contigs[contig]=1\n    for (i=2; i&lt;=NF; i++) if ($i==1) M[contig, i]=1\n}\nEND{\n    for (c in contigs) {\n        printf \"%s\", c\n        for (i=2; i&lt;=ncol; i++) {\n            v = ((c SUBSEP i) in M) ? 1 : 0\n            printf \"%s%d\", OFS, v\n        }\n        printf \"\\n\"\n    }\n}\n' genes_in_contigs.tsv KO_presence_absence_by_gene.tsv &gt; KO_presence_absence_by_contig.tsv\n\n# 4) Convert contig names to split names (naive: appends _split_00001)\nawk -F'\\t' -v OFS='\\t' '\nFNR==1 { $1=\"item_name\"; print; next }\n{ $1 = $1 \"_split_00001\"; print }\n' KO_presence_absence_by_contig.tsv &gt; KO_presence_absence_by_split.tsv\n\n# Import the data to the PROFILE.db\nanvi-import-misc-data -p PROFILE.db -t items KO_presence_absence_by_split.tsv"

    "text": "anvi’o interactive plot - Denitrification - Nitrate reductase - Station 1\n\n\n\nAnvi’o interactive plot showing the presence/absence of transcript annotation associated with denitrification in station 1.\n\n\nFrom this plot we see that:\n\nK00370 (narG) and K00371 (narH) are annotated on the same transcript (bin 1 on figure) which makes sense as they are subunits of the same nitrate reductase enzyme complex. In many bacterial genomes, narG and narH are directly adjacent and commonly co-transcribed as part of a nitrate reductase operon. For example, in E. coli the nar operon appears to contain four genes designated narGHJI (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC211023/pdf/jbacter00182-0317.pdf).Operons are typically transcribed as one long mRNA. Hence, having multiple functions on one transcript here is not surprising.\nTranscripts are annotated with the same gene multiple times. Different microbial populations likely have slightly different sequences for these genes, hence they get assembled into multiple different versions instead of collapsed by the assembler into one sequence. Hence, having multiple transcript with the same function is not surprising.\n\nFrom the coverage data layers, we can see that all the transcripts have coverage from sample S4B (Bottom) ans most for sample S4M (Mid-water) but some might be missing from sample S4S (Surface). Therefore, let’s look at the completeness of denitrification per depth instead of for the whole station.\n\n\nCode\nanvi-estimate-metabolism -c CONTIGS.db -p PROFILE.db -O denitrification_meta --add-coverage\n\n\nFrom the output table we see that, the denitrification module (M00529) shows differences in both abundance (average coverage) and completeness (average detection) across samples. St1_S4S exhibits substantially lower coverage and detection, indicating a reduced presence and/or partial representation of the denitrification pathway in the surface sample. In contrast, St1_S4M and St1_S4B show much higher coverage and detection values, consistent with a more abundant and more complete denitrification potential in deeper waters.

Gene coverages are generally higher in St1_S4B and St1_S4M than in St1_S4S, where several components show low or zero coverage, suggesting a reduced or incomplete representation of the pathway in this sample. A small number of genes display particularly high coverage, implying that certain denitrification functions may be more prevalent than others across the dataset.\nNow using the table above, we can list for each sample the Gene_IDs and KOs with nonzero coverage and you can turn that list into into an enzymes-txt file which can be used to calculated the denitrification completeness score for each sample, using:\n\n\nCode\nanvi-estimate-metabolism --enzymes-txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\nModule\nStepwise completeness\nPathwise completeness\nProportion of unique enzymes present\nEnzymes unique to module\nUnique enzyme hit counts\n\n\n\n\nSt1_S4S\nM00529\n1\n1\n1\nK00376, K02305, K04561\n3, 1, 2\n\n\nSt1_S4M\nM00529\n1\n1\n1\nK00376, K02305, K04561\n6, 2, 5\n\n\nSt1_S4B\nM00529\n1\n1\n1\nK00376, K02305, K04561\n7, 2, 5\n\n\n\nAll three samples (St1_S4S, St1_S4M, and St1_S4B) show complete denitrification pathways according to both stepwise and pathwise KEGG module criteria, indicating that all required enzymatic steps from nitrate to N₂ are represented.\nThe number of hits for the unique enzymes differs among samples. St1_S4B and St1_S4M show higher hit counts for most of the unique enzymes compared to St1_S4S, suggesting that these functions are represented by more gene transcripts or more abundant RNAs in these samples.\nTogether, these results suggest that the denitrification pathways is fully expressed in all three samples, but its relative transcription representation appears to be lower in St1_S4S than in St1_S4M and St1_S4B.\n\nMapping transcripts to genomes of potential denitrifiers\nThe reference genomes listed in this table represent marine prokaryotes that are ecologically plausible contributors to denitrification in Arctic shelf waters such as the Chukchi Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nPhylum\nClass\nEcological niche (marine)\nDenitrification relevance\n\n\n\n\nColwellia psychrerythraea\nPseudomonadota\nGammaproteobacteria\nArctic / cold-adapted, particle-associated\nnarGHI, nirS, norB; often incomplete (N₂O-prone)\n\n\nShewanella baltica\nPseudomonadota\nGammaproteobacteria\nCold coastal waters, redox-flexible\nnar/nap, partial denitrification common\n\n\nPsychromonas arctica\nPseudomonadota\nGammaproteobacteria\nPsychrophilic, organic-matter associated\nNitrate reduction, variable downstream steps\n\n\nMarinobacter alkaliphilus\nPseudomonadota\nGammaproteobacteria\nMarine copiotroph, particle-associated\nnar/nap present in many strains\n\n\nPlanktomarina temperata\nPseudomonadota\nAlphaproteobacteria\nFree-living, bloom-associated\nnapAB, nirS/K, norB; variable nosZ\n\n\nSulfitobacter pontiacus\nPseudomonadota\nAlphaproteobacteria\nBloom-associated Rhodobacteraceae\nnapAB, nirS/K, norB; occasional nosZ"

The resulting assembly produced a set of contigs representing microbial genomic fragments present in Arctic marine surface waters.\nThese contigs were subsequently used as a reference database for read mapping. While the Tara Oceans sampling locations do not overlap geographically with the Chukchi Sea, they provide a comprehensive representation of Arctic marine microbial diversity and metabolic potential, particularly for conserved biogeochemical pathways such as nitrogen cycling.\n\n\nMetatranscriptomic read processing and mapping\nQuality-filtered metatranscriptomic reads were mapped to the Tara Oceans Arctic contigs using Bowtie2 with default end-to-end alignment settings. Mapping was performed in paired-end mode to improve alignment specificity. Both concordant and discordant alignments were reported, although downstream analyses focused on concordantly mapped read pairs.\nMapping performance and alignment statistics\nAcross samples, overall alignment rates ranged from 15.8% to 27.3% of paired-end reads mapping to the Tara Oceans Arctic contigs. The majority of reads aligned concordantly exactly once (11–18%), with a smaller proportion aligning to multiple locations (3–6%). Discordant alignments accounted for approximately 0.5–1% of read pairs.\nThese mapping rates are consistent with expectations for metatranscriptomic datasets mapped to non-site-matched metagenomic references, particularly in polar marine systems where microbial communities exhibit strong spatial structure and strain-level diversity. The observed alignment patterns suggest that a substantial fraction of expressed genes in the Chukchi Sea microbial community are shared with, or closely related to, those represented in the Tara Oceans Arctic metagenomes.\nInterpretation and limitations\nThis reference-based approach enables the identification and relative quantification of expressed genes that are conserved across Arctic marine microbial communities, including key genes involved in nitrogen cycling. However, transcripts derived from locally unique taxa or divergent gene variants absent from the Tara Oceans reference assembly are unlikely to be captured, resulting in an underestimation of total transcript diversity and expression.\nConsequently, analyses based on this approach focus on relative expression patterns of nitrogen-cycle gene families represented in the reference dataset, rather than absolute transcript abundances or the absence of specific metabolic pathways. Despite these limitations, the approach provides a robust framework for exploring nitrogen cycling activity in the Chukchi Sea in the absence of site-specific metagenomic data."
